## ðŸŽ¯ Key Demo Points to Emphasize

### âœ¨ Unique Features
1. **Seamless TLDraw Integration** - PDF viewer is a native TLDraw shape
2. **Full Annotation Support** - All drawing tools work on PDF content
3. **Professional Controls** - Maximize, minimize, close like desktop applications
4. **Persistent State** - Annotations survive all resize/minimize operations
5. **Multi-page Support** - Handle documents with multiple pages
6. **Modular Design** - Easy to integrate into existing applications

### ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights
1. **Custom Shape API** - Follows TLDraw v2 shape conventions
2. **TypeScript Support** - Full type safety and IntelliSense
3. **Responsive Design** - Works on different screen sizes
4. **Performance** - Optimized for smooth annotation experience
5. **Virtual Classroom Ready** - Designed for educational use cases

## ðŸŽ¬ Demo Script Example

> "Let me show you the TLDraw PDF Viewer in action. This is a custom component that brings PDF viewing capabilities directly into TLDraw with full annotation support.

> First, I'll load a sample PDF document... *clicks Load Sample PDF*

> Notice how the PDF appears as a native TLDraw shape with its own container. You can see we have a sample document with some text content and shapes for testing annotations.

> Now let me show you the controls. When I hover over the PDF viewer, you'll see a toolbar appears with maximize, minimize, and close buttons... *hovers to show toolbar*

> I can maximize this to full screen... *clicks maximize* ...and restore it back to the original size... *clicks restore*

> The real power is in the annotation capabilities. I can select any TLDraw tool and draw directly on the PDF content... *selects pen tool and draws*

> I can add text annotations... *adds text* ...shapes... *adds shapes* ...and arrows to point to specific content... *adds arrows*

> Watch what happens when I maximize the PDF with annotations... *maximizes* ...all the annotations stay perfectly positioned and scaled. Same when I restore... *restores* ...and even when I minimize and restore... *minimizes then restores*

> This makes it perfect for virtual classrooms, document review, collaborative editing, and any scenario where you need to annotate PDF content while maintaining the full power of TLDraw's drawing tools."

## ðŸ“± Demo Tips

### Preparation
- Have sample PDF images ready
- Clear any existing shapes from canvas
- Ensure good lighting if recording
- Test all features beforehand

### During Demo
- Move mouse slowly to show interactions
- Pause after each major feature
- Explain what you're doing as you do it
- Show both successful and edge cases

### Common Issues to Avoid
- Don't rush through toolbar hover states
- Make sure annotations are visible (use contrasting colors)
- Test maximize/restore sequence beforehand
- Ensure sample PDF images are loading correctly

## ðŸ“º Recording Setup

If creating a demo video:
1. **Screen Resolution**: 1920x1080 minimum
2. **Recording Area**: Full browser window
3. **Frame Rate**: 30fps minimum
4. **Audio**: Clear narration explaining each step
5. **Duration**: 3-5 minutes for full demo
6. **Editing**: Add callouts for important UI elements

## âœ… Demo Completion Checklist

After the demo, ensure you've shown:
- [x] PDF loading and display
- [x] All toolbar controls (maximize, minimize, restore, close)
- [x] Annotation tools working on PDF
- [x] Annotation persistence through state changes
